# 🐾 Fullstack Domain – Petshop Scheduler

A front-end project developed as part of the **Fullstack Domain** journey.  
The goal is to practice **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** by creating a simple web application for **pet service scheduling**.

- [ ] Date and time picker
- [ ] Display of scheduled appointments
- [ ] Edit and delete functionality
