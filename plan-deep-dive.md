🧩 Arrays, Loops & Objects — Deep Dive Plan
🎯 Goal

Consolidate understanding of loops, array methods, and object manipulation — mastering how to transform data between arrays ↔ objects, and using methods like .map(), .filter(), and .reduce() with confidence.

🗓 Schedule Overview
Day Focus Area Key Objective
08 Loops Review Understand all loop types (for, for...of, for...in, forEach) and their practical use cases
09 Array Methods Master .map(), .filter(), .reduce(), .find(), .some(), .every() and method chaining
10 Integration Combine arrays and objects, convert between them, and build a small “Text Analyzer” project
📘 Day 08 – Loops Review
🎯 Objective

Understand when and how to use each loop type effectively.

🧩 Exercises

Print all numbers from an array using for

Print both index and value (for + index)

Print only values (for...of)

Print object keys (for...in)

Print object values (for...in + dynamic key access)

Sum all numbers using for...of

Do the same with .forEach()

Compare syntax and readability

Skip numbers with continue

Stop loop early with break

💬 Outcome: Create a comparison table showing when to use each loop type.

📘 Day 09 – Array Methods
🎯 Objective

Learn to transform and process data using functional array methods.

🧩 Exercises

Double numbers with .map()

Filter even numbers

Sum all values using .reduce()

Find the first number greater than X

Check if all numbers are positive

Convert strings to uppercase with .map()

Chain .filter() + .map()

Transform array → object using .reduce()

Transform object → array using Object.entries()

Compare performance vs readability

💬 Outcome: Feel comfortable chaining array methods to solve real problems.

📘 Day 10 – Integration: Arrays ↔ Objects
🎯 Objective

Bridge the gap between arrays and objects, simulating real-world data handling.

🧩 Exercises

Array of names → Object with name length

Array of products → Object grouped by category

Object of scores → Array of averages

Object → Array of key: value strings

Array of phrases → Word frequency report

💬 Mini Project – “Text Analyzer”

Input: a sentence

Output:

total words

total characters

most common word

word frequency object

🧠 After This Block

Return to standard exercises (ex063+)

Focus on object manipulation, JSON handling, and small data structures

Prepare for functional JavaScript challenges and API response transformations
