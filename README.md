# Fullstack Mastery ðŸš€

This repository is my personal training ground to become a complete Full Stack Developer.

ðŸ“Œ **Goal:** master every layer of the stack â€” from logical reasoning to real-world application deployment.

## Structure

- `logic/`: daily programming logic exercises
- `challenges/`: technical challenges and mini-projects
- `mock-tests/`: interview and practical test simulations
- `progress.md`: my evolution tracker

## Routine

ðŸ•’ Daily study time: **3 hours**, split between:

- Full Stack Course (Rocketseat)
- Logic training
- Reviews and challenges

ðŸ’¡ Everything here is done with purpose â€” to strengthen reasoning, build technical confidence, and be fully prepared for any job challenge.
